                        the better it tastes. My personal favourite is lettuce. It gives the burger the right amount of freshness and crunchiness.
                        I always eat my burger with ketchup. Most importantly, the thing I love about eating burgers is that I get to eat French fries along with them.
                         They work as a great side to the dish and also make my stomach full.

                                 maintaining blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

                                High blood pressure and cholesterol can be a symptom of too much salt and saturated fats in your diet.
                                
                                Eating a portion of oily fish - such as salmon and trout - each week can also help to lower your risk of developing heart disease. 
                                The high levels of omega-3 fatty 
                                acids in oily fish are good for heart health.A well-balanced diet provides all of the:energy you need to keep active throughout the day

                                Deficiencies in some key nutrients - such as vitamin A, B, C and E, and zinc, iron and selenium - can weaken parts of your immune system.

                            <p>Working in a kitchen can be as challenging as it is rewarding and you must be prepared to work hard. 
                                Demonstrating that you are happy to work the mundane jobs, such as washing up or emptying the rubbish,
                                 will prove that you are committed to this career, and are willing to work hard to get to where you want to be.
                                  When you are more established in your career, these experiences will help you mentor and manage new starters.

                                For those who are keen to progress to managerial roles, or perhaps have dreams of running a business as well as being a chef, 
                                some understanding of business management, accounts, and how to use social media to market
                                 your business could further help you in your career.
                                
                                Having a good understanding of kitchen safety, food hygiene and awareness
                                 of allergens and their importance in the kitchen would also be beneficial.

                                You want cheap filling foods that are healthy, taste great and don’t cost a lot. Your grocery spending is the most flexible

                        school with one dining hall, no off-campus living, and several food sensitivities. I decided to start an Instagram account 
                        (formerly @highflavour) to chronicle my dietary challenges and hopefully inspire others with similar backgrounds.

                        Just a month or two after launching, I decided to study abroad for the first semester of my senior year. My mom, who coached
                         me in high school and happened to be taking an online nutrition and photography course at the time, helped me continue posting
                          on the account while I was abroad. From there, we continued posting our creations on Instagram, learning photography along the
                           way and grew our audience to about 20k within the first year.
                        
                        Just after graduation in 2018, I started my first full-time job at a food media startup (now very successful) in NYC. At the time,
                         we were a very small team and with my very little experience with photography and social media, I was suddenly thrust into a position
                          where I was creating professional content for well-known, worldwide food and beverage brands. After a year,
                           I was able to take my newfound experience
                         with professional content creation and social media/influencer marketing to make Crowded Kitchen a full-time endeavor.
                         When we first started Crowded Kitchen, nearly all of our revenue came from very low-paying sponsored posts on our 
                         Instagram account. We quickly realized that we’d need to diversify to make it full-time, so we took several months to
                          really invest in learning professional photography, videography, editing, and recipe development to become an expert in our field.

Thankfully, creativity happens to be not only a strong point for me but also a passion. I grew to love photography and have spent the 
last several years constantly honing my skills. My mom, also incredibly creative, really leaned into recipe development and has become
 an expert at creating vegan and gluten-free recipes from scratch.

As our skillsets widened, we realized that there’s a huge market for content creation for food and beverage brands. We started offering our
 photography and recipe development services to brands for use in their own social media marketing. That arm of our business
 currently accounts for around 50% (or more) of our revenue, and we have several long-term monthly and yearly contracts with large brands.

                    <p>Cooking is considered a passion by most individuals around the world.
                         This passion became an industry in most businesses around the world.
                          The hospitality industry is where cooking belongs to.
                         Cooks transformed their passion into a business by establishing a restaurant and fast food chains around the world.
                         Cooking or the art of cooking is the art and science of preparing food for consumption by humans. 
                         
                         The techniques of cooking and the ingredients used for it vary from place to place and from human to human.
                          There are various types of gas stoves which are used for cooking food like an electric stove, gas stove, 
                          ovens and even baked Chulhas.

The history of cooking is still unknown but our ancestors or the early humans invented fire and gradually
 started using it to cook their food. In earlier times people used clay pots as vessels in which they used to make their food.
  Earlier people were not aware of so many types of dishes, they only used fire to cook the raw meat which they got from hunting animals.
 With time and evolution of human beings the cooking methods and the cooked menu list has also changed.
 ooking is a need for one and all and everyone must learn how to cook to make their lives easier. Cooking is the skill of making
  food by making use of many ingredients. Cooking can be done through various methods like boiling, grilling, sautéing, etc. It is not clearly
   known when did our ancestors started to cook but studies show that they began Cooking using fire some million years ago. Cooking is required
    to make the food items edible and healthy. Cooking is also an art as the cook is using all his abilities to prepare a masterpiece in itself 
    that is fit for consumption by a human being. Cooking techniques and ingredients vary from region to region and person to person. In early
     times clay pots were used for cooking on open fire. Cooking makes it more tasty and presentable, more easier to digest, and kills the bacteria 
     present in the raw ingredients.

Cooking is a necessity for all of us but some also follow it as a profession. But according to our society Cooking is only meant for females,
 which is wrong. Nowadays it is a requirement for both the genders as it makes us independent and also we can support our family in difficult times.
  It is a source of pleasure and satisfaction for some people. Cooking like other subjects should be a part of your curriculum. In this way children 
  will get to learn the importance of it which will be helpful to them in their near future. It is a good productive activity as it includes the use
   of both mind and body. It is a kind of stress buster for someone. We all have seen our mothers, grandmothers and sisters Cooking in the kitchen
    and that too in the most loving way. But the introduction of fast food has changed the basic concept of cooking. It is human tendency to incline 
towards the things which need less or no effort. Fast food is one of them, no second thoughts that they are not good for our health.
